PROJECT DESCRIPTION - TravelO is a TRIP/TOUR Planner. Basically, the user can find the different places/cities according to the provinces. And this page will the the user about that place, famous cuisines, activities to do and many more. Even the user itself can also add his/her own experience with CRUD functionality and alsa have a chance to edit or delete it later. This web site also allows users to create a To-Do list for thier trip. Added the authentication and authorization for the user and admins. Only the admisninstrator can operate the CRUD functionality while user can't and user can only able to see the lists. Also added a different method for registration which is google. 

NOTE - My web site runs completely well on the local machine but when I tried to run the website on the Smarter ASP server it crashies almost at every point and ended up with many errors.
